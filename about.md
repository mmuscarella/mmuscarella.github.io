Welcome!

I am broadly interested in the role of microorganisms in the environment and how environmental changes affect the structure and function of microbial communities. Currently, I am working with freshwater bacterial communities and how they are responding to changes in local resources (e.g., Carbon, Phosphorus). My research uses a mixture of field observations, laboratory experimentation, and genomic analysis. Learn more about my active research here.

In addition to my research, I take part in various teaching responsibilities, mentoring, and outreach activities. I have experience teaching introductory courses such as Intro Bio and Intro Microbiology, upper level undergraduate courses such as Environmental Microbiology, and graduate courses such as Microbial Metagenomics and Quantitative Biodiversity. I have experience mentoring both High School and Undergraduate students and encourage students to develop independent projects (if you are interested in conducting research with me, please contact me). I am also a bit of a computer geek and enjoy learning about and working with various tools to analyze and interpret data in unique ways.

To learn more about me and my interests, please feel free to follow me on twitter (@MarioMuscarella) and GitHub (mmuscarella).
