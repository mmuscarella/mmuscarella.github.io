**Coming Soon**: The Microbial Ecology and Ecophysiology Lab at the University of Alaska Fairbanks! In August 2020 I will be moving to the [Institute of Arctic Biology]( https://www.iab.uaf.edu/) and the [Department of Biology & Wildlife]( https://www.bw.uaf.edu/) at UAF. 

I am currently a postdoctoral Fellow in the [del Giorgio Lab](http://www.gril.uqam.ca/del_Giorgio.html) at the Université du Quebéc à Montréal studying large scale patterns of microbial metabolism in boreal waters to understand the local and regional drivers. Microbial metabolic rates link the composition of microbial communities to aquatic carbon dynamics. Based on previous studies, there are a number of abiotic and biotic factors which may control microbial metabolism, including physical properties such as pH and hydrological flow and biotic factors such as species interactions in the microbial community. However, there have been no large-scale studies conducted to understand these connections. Because microbial metabolism is the missing gap linking the structure and function of microbial communities, understanding drivers of microbial metabolism will ultimately help constrain predictive models. 

I am broadly interested in the role of microorganisms in the environment and how environmental changes alter the structure and function of microbial communities. I am interested in how microbial communities respond to changes in local resources (e.g., carbon, phosphorus). These responses may include differences in community composition, species interactions, and ecosystem processes. My research uses a mixture of field observations, laboratory experimentation, bioinformatics, and theory. Learn more about my active research [here]( {{ site.url }}/research).
