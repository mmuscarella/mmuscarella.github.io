  Microbial Ecology and Ecophysiology
</p>

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [O'Dwyer Lab](https://publish.illinois.edu/odwyerlab/) at the University of Illinois. I am currently studying phylogenetic patterns in microbial communities and the relationship between phylogenetic patterns and traits. I am also using consumer-resource models to better understand microbe-resource interactions. I am expanding my quantitative and theoretical toolbox in order to broaden my knowledge and help answer diverse questions in microbial ecology.

I am broadly interested in the role of microorganisms in the environment and how environmental changes affect the structure and function of microbial communities. I am interested in how microbial communities respond to changes in local resources (e.g., carbon, phosphorus). These responses may include differences in community composition, species interactions, and ecosystem processes. My research uses a mixture of field observations, laboratory experimentation, genome analysis, and theory. Learn more about my active research [here]( {{ site.url }}/research).
