        I am broadly interested in using a traits based perspective to understand microbial community structure and function. However, since the majority of microbes are not in culture, it is difficult to know their traits. Recent works suggests that we may be able to use the phylogenetic relationships between organisms to understand the traits of the uncultured biosphere. But, the predictions often differ. Specifically, predictions based on trait conservation differ from those based on ancestral states. Therefore, I am working on developing theory to explain the differences in trait conservation and ancestral states. In addition, I am testing these theoretical predictions using genomic features across the bacterial and archaeal tree of life. This work uses simulation based models and the analysis of ~4000 genomes.

## Experimental Microbial Communities 
One of the major challenges in microbial ecology has been designing methods to experimentally manipulate microbial communities. This stems from a desire to show replicated responses to environmental stimuli. In collaboration with the O'Dwyer and Kuehn Labs, I have been working to develop synthetic communities in the lab that mimic natural microbial communities. We have developed a computational pipeline that uses 16S rRNA survey data and bacterial isolate databases to determine the best representative community of isolates. We are currently testing this method with a lake community.


**Microbial Carbon Traits** <br>
Heterotrophic bacteria in ecosystems determine whether organic carbon is respired and lost as CO_2 or converted into biomass and retained in food webs. Many factors control how bacteria process carbon, but perhaps the most important factor is bacterial growth efficiency (BGE). BGE reflects the proportion of assimilated organic carbon that is converted into bacterial biomass. When BGE is high, more carbon is turned into biomass and thus potentially enters the food web. In contrast, when BGE low, more carbon is released as CO_2. In this project I have been measuring BGE in a set of bacterial isolates. Using these isolates, I measure BGE when grown with only a single carbon source. I use different carbon substrates to represent different types of resources available to heterotrophic bacteria. Overall, I have found that variation in BGE is better explained by consumer identity, and I have also identified physiological trade-offs related to growth strategy. These results provide a trait-based framework for understanding linkages between community structure and function due to the physiological constraints on BGE, and suggest that large changes in community composition or available resources may alter BGE in predictive ways.

**Resource Heterogeneity** <br>

Food webs are often regulated by the bottom-up effects of resource availability. However, because resource pools often exist as heterogeneous mixtures of individual resources, resource heterogeneity may also affect the diversity of local communities. I have tested this hypothesis using both experimental and observations approaches. First, I measured the responses of aquatic microbial food webs in experimental mesocosms to the addition of 4 different phosphorus (P) sources. My results demonstrate that not all P resources are the same; although historically overlooked, P resource heterogeneity may have important implications for understanding and predicting the structure and function of aquatic communities. Second, I surveyed bacterial communities in lakes that spanned a resource concentration gradient and characterized resource heterogeneity in these lakes using high-resolution mass spectrometry of the dissolved organic matter (DOM) pool. I observed that resource concentration and resource heterogeneity affect resource--diversity relationships, but in different ways. These results have implications for understanding the interactions between bacteria and resources (C and P), and suggest that changes in resource inputs may alter the structure and function of bacterial communities.

**Resource Subsidies** <br>

The movement of resources between terrestrial and aquatic habitats has strong effects on ecological processes in recipient ecosystems. Allochthonous inputs modify the quality and quantity of the available resource pool in ways that may alter the composition and stability of recipient communities. Inputs of terrestrial dissolved organic carbon (tDOC) into aquatic ecosystems represent a large influx of resources that has the potential to affect local communities, especially microorganisms. To evaluate the effects of terrestrial inputs on aquatic bacterial community composition and stability, we manipulated the supply rate of tDOC to a set of experimental ponds. Overall, these results show that altered aquatic terrestrial linkages can have profound effects on the activity and stability of the base of the food web and thus can alter ecosystem functioning.
