**Phylogenetic Patterns of Microbial Traits** <br>
I am broadly interested in using a traits based perspective to understand microbial community structure and function. However, since the majority of microbes are not in culture, it is difficult to know their traits. Recent works suggests that we may be able to use the phylogenetic relationships between organisms to understand the traits of the uncultured biosphere. But, the predictions often differ. Specifically, predictions based on trait conservation differ from those based on ancestral states. Therefore, I am working on developing theory to explain the differences in trait conservation and ancestral states. In addition, I am testing these theoretical predictions using genomic features across the bacterial and archaeal tree of life. This work uses simulation based models and the analysis of ~4000 genomes. Stay tuned for updates!!!!!!
