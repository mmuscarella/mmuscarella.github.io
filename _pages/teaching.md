# Course Development

**Microbial Ecology**
As part of a graduate education course, I developed a broad microbial ecology course. This course covers the fundamentals of microbial ecology in three main sections: populations, communities, and ecosystems. Populations: students explore population growth and simple population models. Communities: students explore the developments in microbial community ecology and core ecological theory. Ecosystems: students explore biogeochemistry and how environmental conditions drive ecosystem function.

# Previous Courses

**Quantitative Biodiversity** <br>
*Years Taught*: 2016 <br>
Graduate-level course that focuses on theory, patterns, metrics, and tools used to study biodiversity. Students calculate diversity metrics, generate and quantify diversity relationships, visualize multivariate data, and conduct phylogenetic tests. Students use modern statistical computing and graphics environments (i.e., R), as well as version control tools (i.e., GitHub). See previous course website for more information.

**Microbial Metagenomics** <br>
*Years Taught*: 2011, 2012<br>
Graduate-level course that focused the teaching students general skills in microbial metagenomics. Lessons included: hypothesis generation, sample collection and processing, sequencing methods, sequence data analysis, general statistics, hypothesis testing approaches.

**Environmental Microbiology** <br>
*Years Taught*: 2013<br>
Undergraduate-leve course designed to introduce students with the fundamental skills needed in environmental microbiology including how experiments are: designed, performed, analyzed, and communicated.

**Introductory Microbiology Lab** <br>
*Years Taught*: 2012<br>
Undergraduate-level course that focused on teaching the fundamental skills needed for microbiology


**Introductory Biology Lab** <br>
*Years Taught*: 2011, 2013, <br>
Undergraduate-level course that focused on cellular and molecular biology fundamentals.
