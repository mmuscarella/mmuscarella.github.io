# Teaching Overview

*Teaching philosophy coming soon*


# Course Development

**Microbial Ecology**
As part of a graduate education course, I developed a broad microbial ecology course. This course covers the fundamentals of microbial ecology in three main sections: populations, communities, and ecosystems. Populations: students explore population growth and simple population models. Communities: students explore the developments in microbial community ecology and core ecological theory. Ecosystems: students explore biogeochemistry and how environmental conditions drive ecosystem function. See example course material here (*coming soon*).


# Previous Courses

**Quantitative Biodiversity** <br>
*Years Taught*: 2016 <br>
Graduate-level course that focuses on theory, patterns, metrics, and tools used to study biodiversity. Students calculate diversity metrics, generate and quantify diversity relationships, visualize multivariate data, and conduct phylogenetic tests. Students use modern statistical computing and graphics environments (i.e., R), as well as version control tools (i.e., GitHub). See previous course website for more information.
