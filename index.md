# Welcome!

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [O'Dwyer Lab](https://publish.illinois.edu/odwyerlab/) at the University of Illinois. I am currently studying phylogenetic patterns in microbial communities and the relationship between phylogenetic patterns and traits. I am expanding my quantitative and theoretical toolbox in order to broaden my knowledge and help answer diverse questions in microbial ecology.

I am broadly interested in the role of microorganisms in the environment and how environmental changes effect the structure and function of microbial communities. My interests include freshwater microbial communities and how they respond to changes in local resources (e.g., Carbon, Phosphorus). These changes may include differences in community composition, species interactions, and ecosystem processes. My research uses a mixture of field observations, laboratory experimentation, genome analysis, and theory. Learn more about my active research [here]( {{ site.url }}/research).
